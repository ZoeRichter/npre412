Thus, the polluter pays. The supply curve, $S_i$, would then shift, increasing the market price $P_i$. The levelof production, $Q_i$ would then fall to a point where P becomes equal to the SMC. There are other ways to model this, such as a damage focused model rather than a price focused model.

    "- Nuclear power benefits less from tax subsidies than some other sources of energy\n",
    "- However, governments invest heavily in nuclear through other means\n",
    "- Loan garuntees in nuclear power construction projects reduce the risk incurred by utilities\n",
    "- The Price Anderson act limits the liabilities of nuclear utilities in the event of a catastrophic accident\n",
