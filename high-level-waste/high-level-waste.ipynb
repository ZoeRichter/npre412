    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson, you will be equipped to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall the history of nuclear waste policy in the United States\n",
    "- Recognize the NWPA waste class of various nuclear fuel cycle materials\n",
    "- Compare the pros and cons of nuclear waste policies internationally\n",
    "- Distinguish among current waste classification schemes domestically and internationally\n",
    "- Suggest potential alternative waste classification schemes\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of current policy on domestic nuclear power production\n"
