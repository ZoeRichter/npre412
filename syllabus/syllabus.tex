\paragraph{Objectives:} 

This course will equip students to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Quantitative analysis of the impact of the nuclear power industry; 
\item nuclear fuel cycle and capital costs for thermal and fast reactors; 
\item optimization of the use of nuclear fuels to provide the lowest energy costs and highest system performance; 
\item differentiate among features of fossil fuel systems, fission systems, and controlled thermonuclear fusion systems.

\paragraph{Class Policies:}  

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{Integrity:} This is an institution of higher
learning. You will be swiftly ejected from the course if you are caught
undermining its integrity. Note the
\href{http://www.provost.illinois.edu/academicintegrity/students.html}{Student's
Quick Reference Guide to Academic Integrity} and the
\href{http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html}{Academic
Integrity Policy and Procedure}.  
\item[] \textbf{Attendance:} Regular attendance is mandatory. Request approval for absence for extenuating circumstances prior to absence.
\item[] \textbf{Electronics:} Active participation is essential and expected. 
        Accordingly, students must turn off all electronic devices (laptop, 
        tablets, cellphones, etc.) during class. Exceptions may be granted for 
        laptops if engaging in computational exercises or taking notes. 
\item[] \textbf{Collaboration:} Collaboratively reviewing course materials and studying for exams with fellow students can be enriching.  This is recommended.  However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently and materials submitted as homework should be the result of one's own independent work.
\item[] \textbf{Late Work:} Late work has a halflife of 1 hour. That is, adjusted for lateness, your grade $G(t)$ is a decaying percentage of the raw grade $G_0$. An assignment turned in $t$ hours late will recieve a grade according to the following relation:
\begin{align*}
        G(t) &= G_0e^{-\lambda t}
        \intertext{where}
        G(t) &= \mbox{grade adjusted for lateness}\\
        G_0 &= \mbox{raw grade}\\
        \lambda &= \frac{ln(2)}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}} = \mbox{decay constant} \\
        t &= \mbox{time elapsed since due [hours]}\\
        t_{1/2} &= 1 = \mbox{half-life [hours]} \\
\end{align*}
\item[] \textbf{Make-up Work:} There will be no negotiation about late work except in the case of absence documented by an absence letter from the Dean of Students.  The university policy for requesting such a letter is in \href{http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part5_1-501.html}{the Student Code}. Please note that such a letter is appropriate for many types of conflicts, but that religious conflicts require special early handling. In accordance with university policy, students seeking an excused absence for religious reasons should complete the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances Form, which can be found on the Office of the Dean of Students website. The student should submit this form to the instructor and the Office of the Dean of Students by the end of the second week of the course to which it applies. 

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Accessibility:} I hope that this course will be inclusive and 
accommodating for all learners. As such, I am committed upholding the vision 
and values of \href{http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/index.html}{Inclusive Illinois}
in my 
classroom.  With regard to accommodating all learners, please note that many 
resources are provided through 
\href{http://disability.illinois.edu/academic-support/accommodations}{the 
Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services}.  To request 
particular accommodations, please contact me as soon as possible so that we can 
work out any necessary arrangements.

\paragraph{Other Resources:} 
University students typically experience a wide range of stressors during their 
time on campus. Accordingly, campus resources exist to help students manage their 
stress levels as well as their general mental health while navigating this environment. I 
hope you will take advantage of these campus resources as soon as they can be 
of help.
