	abstract = {"The Nuclear Fuel Cycle" has been extensively revised since its previous edition published in 1999 and it includes a whole new chapter on nuclear safeguards. The book covers all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle-from cradle to grave. Topics include the available nuclear fuel resources (uranium and thorium), extraction of the metals from the ore, fabrication of nuclear fuel, use of the fuel for power generation, and management and disposal of used fuel and radioactive wastes. Other topics discussed are basic reactor physics, in-core and out-of-core fuel management, possible fuel cycles, nuclear power economics, and nuclear safeguards. The various methods of generating electricity are also described and compared, concentrating on their environmental effects.},
