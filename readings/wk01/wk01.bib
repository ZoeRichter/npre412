	abstract = {Although economics will certainly not be the only criterion for deploying fast reactors, it will be an important one. In this paper we will present a method for analysing their competitiveness in comparison with thermal neutron reactors. We will use the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) method to compare the production costs of each technology.
For forecasting the uranium cost, which is an important question for competitiveness, we have proposed a model based on supply curve. This model approximates the uranium costs over the assumed 60-year operating lifetime of new reactors, according to their commissioning date.
Concerning the fuel cycle costs, we have taken into account the fact that they will differ according to whether or not the reactor is in a country which has already chosen to treat and recycle spent fuel (back-end of the cycle).
A uranium equivalent value is then calculated for which the kWh costs of each reactor technology would be the same. This enables us to determine the period when FRs will become competitive according to various parameters.
The uranium supply curve appears to be the most influential parameter for any given nuclear demand, followed by the discount rate, prior choices regarding the back-end of the cycle, and the additional investment cost of FRs in comparison with PWRs.},
